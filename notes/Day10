Python Day10 notes
-------------------------------
Lists: a list is a mutable data structure used to store a collection of items.
       Defined using square Brackets []
       Contains elements of different data types
       allow duplicates. 
indexing can be done in a list. It may be positive or negative.

we can modify individual elements in a list 
    ex: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
        fruits[0] = "orange"
        print(fruits)  #Output: ["orange", "banana", "cherry"]

   Methods:
       syntax for methods is 
        list_name.method_name
1) append(): adds an element to the end of the list.
2) insert(): inserts an element at a specific index.
3) remove(): removes the first occurrence of a specified index ( or the last element if no index is given).
4) pop() : removes and returns the element at a specified index ( or the last element if no index is given).
5) index() : returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified element.
6) count() : Returns the number of occurrences of a specified element in the list.
7) sort() : Sorts the list in ascending order. 
8) reverse(): reverses the order of the elements in the list.

List Concatenation:
lists can be concatenated by using the + operator, which creates a new list containing elements from both lists.

List Comprehensions:
List Comprehensions provide a concise way to creae lists using a single line of code.

Syntax:
  new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]
      eg: inp = input().split()
           l = [int(item) for item in inp]
          print(l)

Tuple: Tuples used to store a collection of items 
       a tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of elements       
       it is similar to a list, but the main difference is that tuple cannot be changed after creation.
       once a tuple is created, you cannot add, remove, or modify its elements.
to create a tuple, we use parentheses () with elements separated by commas 

Methods: count() and index().
