Python Day7 notes
------------------------------

Loops : 
Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is True or for a specific number of iterations 

Types of Loops : 
       1) while 
       2) for

While Loop : 
The while loop execute a block of code as long as a specific condition is true.It is continuously checks the condition before each iteration
 and stops when the condition becomes false

Syntax:
while condition:
 #code 

For Loop : 
A for loop is a way to repeat a block of code for each item in a collection or for a specific range of numbers 

Syntax: 
for variable in range(start:stop:step):
 #code 

for loop can be used for sequence (like list,tuple,string,dictionary) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence

Syntax:
for item in sequence
 #code

 Nested loops: 
 where loop is placed inside another loop

Syntex:
for outer_variable in outer_sequence:
 #code 
  for inner_variable in inner_sequence
   #code
