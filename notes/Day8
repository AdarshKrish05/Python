Python day8 notes
------------------------------

Break: if during the execution of the loop Python interpreter encounters break, it immediately stops the loop execution and exits out of it

Syntax:
while condition:
 #code block
 if some_condition :
  break 
#Exit the loop if the condition is met.

continue: it is used to skip the rest of the current iteration in aloop and move to the next iteration 

Syntax:
while condition:
 #code block
 if some_condition :
  continue 
#skip this iteration.
