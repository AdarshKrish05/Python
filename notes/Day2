Type Casting : means converting data type 
 There are two types of type casting -
            ===>  implicit type casting - happens directly
                         Eg : a=3 is int type 
            ===>  Explicit type casting - converting type of variable 
                         Eg : b=3.14 is Float 
                               c=int(b) then c becomes 3 
Comment : 
  Comments are used mainly in two cases -
      a) To avoid a line of code from running/executing
      b) To avoid description of a code from being treated as code and
         executed.

     2) There are two types of comments -
          a) Single line comments ( # )
               Eg: #a = 3
          b) Multi line comments ( “”” “”” )
               Eg: “”” a = 3
                       b = 6 “””
